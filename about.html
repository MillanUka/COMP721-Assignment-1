        <h4>What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site that we should know about?</h4>
        <p>I used Bootstrap for the CSS(No JQuery)</p>
        <h4>What parts did you have trouble with?</h4>
        <p>
            I had issues with the insertion to the database. I was had an issue with adding the share value. I found
            that the issue was that I had used a different variable name, causing the share value to be null.
        </p>
        <h4>What would you like to do better next time?</h4>
        <p>
            Something I would like to do better next time. Is probably make the website more secure. Right now the user can 
            do XSS attacks on the website. There is also no protections against SQL injections.
        </p>
        <h4>What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/"><b>The PHP manual</b></a></li>

        </ul>
        <h4>What you have learnt along the way?</h4>
        <p>
            I learnt a lot about bootstrap, which is useful in creating responsive web application, that display both on
            mobile and desktop. I also learned a lot about working with databases with php.
            I had previously used Java and JDBC in Derby and MySQL database, but using PHP makes it easier to use
            databases for web applications. I also learned a lot more about working with HTML forms,
            which I previously didn't have much knowledge in.
